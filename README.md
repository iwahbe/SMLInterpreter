# SMLInterpreter
Partial interpreter for SML, written in C++.

This project began as part of an assignment from [Jim Fix](http://people.reed.edu/~jimfix/), relating to his class on languages. I ported a version of this parser, written in Python. 

The entry file for the program is miniml.cc. Currently, this project only acts as a dumb interpreter, and does not support loading files.
